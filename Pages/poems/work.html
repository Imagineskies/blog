            <h3>Fear</h3>
            <p>
              I want you to hear me.<br />
              Cause things you see will never be true.<br />
            </p>
            <p>You see me as whole, as full.<br />
              I'm as empty as the hope I build on.<br />
              The dwindle ash of the fire I once was.<br />
              The roar I would produce could make shock waves.<br />
              The hallways were always so abandoned.<br />
              As if everyone decided to skip class.<br />
              And the only thing I was good for was being used as a hallpass.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't understand my worth.<br />
              It's as unknown as the sea.<br />
              The answer to my purpous beats me.<br />
              It's slowly picked apart neatly.<br />
              I'm a detainee to the darkest parts of my mind.<br />
              The ones I can't understand.<br />
            </p>
            <p>If you've ever spent time with me you'll see.<br />
              The moments where I sit in silence are the real me.<br />
              Now this is the past that I remember.<br />
              The one where my mind was dismembered.<br />
              Thoughts and questions scatered across the page.
              "You'll feel my rage!"<br />
              My recolection of my defender.<br />
            </p>

            <h3>Forgoten</h3>
            <p>Forgotten,<br />
              Past.<br />
              Maybe i'll last.<br />
              The part,<br />
              The pain,<br />
              Drives me insane.<br />
              Drives me to a crash covered with rocks from the days of skipping.
              The days of wishing.<br />
              The feeling of being missing no mater how many times you've been found.
              Calling the hounds to search me down.<br />
              Me sitting still trying not to make a sound.
              The recreation of fantasies to fulfill my desires.
              Yet every glimpse backfires into a nightmare.
              One to tear my hopes up like confetti.<br />
              I become unsteady. <br />
              Not ready to face this head on.</p>

            <p>Attemps
            </p>
            <p>I can remember my first attempt.<br />
              The night was cold.<br />
              Stars were out.<br />
              No one around.
            </p>
            <p>The sounds of crickets, wind.<br />
              Time is slow.<br />
              Seconds turn to Hours,<br />
              Boardom turns to tears.<br />
              My sight brings out the channels of fear.
              From the first step to the second.<br />
              I reckoned my commitment to infringe on the promise.
              The calmest of times caused the deepest of crimes.
            </p>
            <p>The thieft of care,<br />
              My Despair,<br />
              This isn't fair,<br />
              What more to take?
            </p>
            <p>As my life moves slowly like a leaf falling from a tree.
              Getting uprooted and raked,<br />
              Hidden and quaked,<br />
              Misplaced,<br />
              Reshaped.
            </p>
            <p>The haunts that build,<br />
              for the lions thrilled.<br />
              My colapsed lungs to broken to breath the names.
              All the claims gone up in flames.<br />
              They hurt like labor pains.<br />
              Tracing veins,<br />
              cutting lanes,<br />
              they still remain,<br />
              Engrained in the skin,<br />
              Retained in the mind,<br />
              Maintained for the replays,<br />
              The edits,<br />
              The forgeries <br />
              The medics,<br />
              The lonely nights,<br />
              The busy days.<br />
              Frightening heights,<br />
              Bitter ways.

            <h3>A Life</h3>
            <p>One day, I woke up<br />
              I staider to the ground, but my face looked up.
              Never before did I ever believe it would come to this.
              But not one second was I not prepared for this.
              I grew up thinking that life was a gift to me
              But as I grew older I realized that it was nothing but pain to me.
              The sky was bright, but my mind was dark.
              As if the power grid of hope, crashed<br />
              And the fire from the overloaded circutes burned deep inside me.
              I petitoned for happiness and the world denied me
              So all throughout middle school the thought of suicide sat beside me
              With old memories of when life used to excite me
              This was a new me<br />
              One that I had grown to become<br />
              I wasn't happy about it. <br />
              It tormented me<br />
              The doubt of actions changed my actions to limit them into thoughts.
              The light everyone said was at the end of the tunel was just another train.
              Here to crash into me<br />
              To set me back further than it ever did before.
              Waking up in a panic at four<br />
              hallucinating a nock at the door<br />
              Yet it was nothing more than then the simple threat I faced every day
              Not wanting to continue with my day.<br />
              People would say "Im here for you"<br />
              Ever get that feeling that people aren't actualy there for you?
              Is this true for you?<br />
              Well it was for me.<br />
              And no mater how good the glasses, my depression made it so I couldn't see
              I was forbiden to live life<br />
              Everyone was happy and so was I<br />
              Just by cutting or getting high I was able to pass the time by
              I survived day after day just wondering
              Why?<br />
              Why was I alive?<br />
              So I did anything to get a distraction.
              I made transactions to buy my happiness
              But like all adictions<br />
              This high didn't last very long. <br />
              It brought me to a place where I wasn't strong.
              I could be 9 feet tall and it feel like I was at the ground.
              Cause no mater how hard I cried, I never made a sound
              But I never gave anyone the headphones to listen
              That was my decision built to protect me from others judgement.
              And it went well.<br />
              Until I almost fell from the edge I had built
              I would go through all the effort to climb a mountan if it ment I could fall right off.
              All most did.<br />
              But 4 people kept that from happening<br />
              If only that was the last.<br />
              At this very moment I have a past that could bring you to your knees
              And don't for a second think that I can say that with ease
              Like it's a breeze. <br />
              It a pain<br />
              But it's better to relese then to keep it lobbied in my brain.
              If I did that i'd go insane.<br />
              Clock back just a few months<br />
              Once in my life where I was actualy told to kill myself.
              It broke me<br />
              Coming from someone whome I though loved me to death
              It did nothing but bring me closer.<br />
              I did nothing but attempt to put people before me
              Even when thoes people were bad for me<br />
              It was something that I couldn't believe
              that those said they'd be there for me turned there back on me.
              It's okay...<br />
              I see...<br />
              I'll just fuck the world and make this my destiny
              To kill myself, end it all, the world is dead to me
              Yet no mater how badly I tried, I couldn't leave.
              I either failed, or someone got to me.<br />
              But no one could heal that I was impailed by my enemy
              No one got me<br />
              But something caught me<br />
              It sat me down, turned everything around and just talked to me<br />
              It's been 1 year since I last drew some blood<br />
              With that climbing I see nothing but resigning from the day to day janator. Having to deal with all the shit other people left for me. To say fuck you to socity to create my verson of life where I am myself
              and I am happy. But that doesn't mean that I can't have sad days. Thoes will still come. But I will move past it. Past them.</p>

            <h3>School</h3>
            <p>My heart.<br />
              Dipped in chocolate.<br />
              Ripped apart.<br />
              I remember walking down the halls<br />
              I remember the start.<br />
              It was a fairy tale, wishing well.<br />
              Called it spell, more like a curse.<br />
              With every ring it was cast.<br />
              Memories overlap and they last.<br />
              There's never no such thing as "remembering my past."
              This is my future.<br />
              I live it.<br />
              Eat, sleep, breath, repeat it<br />
              Don't know if I'd feel it...<br />
              You know?<br />
              When I'm pinched.<br />
              Always told that's the best way to wake up from a dream.
              But it's not.<br />
              The only thing pinching does is leave scars from the times I tried to wake up and failed.
              The white chalk, black marker, red ink.
              Let this sink in.<br />
              The desk, the chairs, the fights, the dares, the pressure, the stairs.
              The things I try to bare with little or no care and you want me to try harder?
              Pick up the pin more?<br />
              Read more?<br />
              You think staring at words that only make me crawl into an abyss won't make me run out the door?
              You want me to care more?<br />
              You don't give two shits about me and you tell me to keep my face up off the floor?
              What gives you the right?<br />
              As a teacher you are to guide me not thrive off me.
              Not make the class you past, another thing to type down.
              I'm surrounded around people who tell me I'm either going to swim or sink but they never accounted for the one kid who wanted to drowned.
              Who wanted to die.<br />
              You label me not working as laziness yet in my mind I'm the craziest.
              I sleep in class trying to create my happiness.
              Fuck school I'm bad at this.<br />
              I've had this shit.<br />
              I cry at my desk cause I want to fuck this shit.
              Kids dropping pins out the window and I'm just thinking if I jump will I die from this.
              I can't blame my teachers, they weren't prepared for this.
              All most declared forfeit.<br />
              All these test and numbers and I can't see for shit.
            </p>
            <p>I'm done with it.<br />
              My papers are loose, my tie is my noose, the uniform is my tux, the room is my coffin, and so so much this happens way too often.
              The day starts my clock, the one I stair at waiting for the end of class the shattered glass I walk on to make it to the next.
              The hexadecimal number of times I blew things out of proportion I'm a pyrotechnical calling all my feelings making them comprehensible as an unexceptional human being the forgettable beams people call my brightness yet they don't mean
              it
              by
              the slightest
              I'm not to be looked to.<br />
              Who would want to.<br />
              My intake of life is swalloed with a knife something sharp to make this go down easy I think I feel quezy

            <p>What way to start they can't find a beat.
              My heart is gone.
            </p>
            <p>The empty carcasses of bones lost in memories and deep hidden zones.
              I use the tones that carry weight in my voice.
              They make me stronger and tougher.<br />
              Bigger and buffer.<br />
              I try not to suffer.
            </p>
            <p>I bring myself pain that drives me too rain down my names.
              I forgive you I just need something inside my brain.
              Something to make this time feel worth it.
            </p>
            <p>Yet I need a permit to start building.<br />
              Just a home.<br />
              Somewhere that's so soft to touch and so rough it can bare all you're problems.
              I'm talking to the wallpaper that stops me like a jawbreaker the last time you were my screen saver.
              I'm innovative with my self-harm but that's not what my teachers meant when they called me an innovator.
            </p>
            <p>I speak so much nonsense you'll need a translator.
              I've committed a crime and the police have there best illustrator.
              I need an educator to teach me something other than pain.
              I need someone to tell me that getting high isn't the worst way to end the pain.
              I need something to bring me to back away from the edge but all I see are veins.
              I'm doing 90 on I-90 and I'm constantily switching lanes.
            </p>
            <p>You call it a distraction I call it a coping skill.
              I call it a coping skill you call it poisin.
              I say I want to die you say I don't.<br />
              You refues to understand me I say I'll go.
            </p>
            <p>I'm trapped in my thoughs when I try so hard to get out.
              I slam on the walls beging to to be let free.
              I walk slowly to the end of the sea.<br />
              Ya see?<br />
              You know me?<br />

            <h3>Me</h3>
            <p>It's weird.<br>
              It's painful.<br>
              People think you have to break a bone to feel pain, but that's simply not true. <br>
              Bones, cuts, bruses, those heal. <br>
              Some faster than others, but that will be fixed. <br>
              It's the mental pain that lasts forever. <br>
              I am a girl. <br>
              Yet, unlike girls born one at birth, I don't have breasts, wide hips, a vagina. <br>
              I can't give birth, my voice is deep, I have a Adams Apple. <br>
              I'm built like a man but im not one. <br>
              I know im not one. <br>
              Yet everyday I can't help but be reminded of my pain. <br>
              This was a mistake. <br>
              I, was a mistake. <br>
              By body doesn't match my mind. <br>
              And as time goes on, the pain only gets worse, and worse, and worse. <br>
              I don't shower like others. <br>
              Once every week, every two weeks. <br>
              I wear womens underwear, bra's, dresses, skirts, flannel shirts, cute tops and leggi<br>ngs.
              I wear wigs with different styles and colors. <br>
              Makeup and scents, time and time again, but it's not enough. <br>
              It's not. <br>
              You may think that calling me he, him, son, boy, RaKwan doesn't effect me. <br>
              But for me, this is torture. <br>
              This is pain. <br>
              Overwhelming, distracting, depression inducing pain. <br>
              People love to say, you're faking it or it's just a phase. <br>
              And I don't care if you knew when you were 5 or 15. <br>
              You know when you're trans. <br>
              You get that feeling in your bones. <br>
              That, feeling you get when you know bad things are comming.<br>
              That strike of dysphoria that kills you when you walk, talk...when you awake. <br>
              It makes you shake at the though of people assuming your gender from how you look or don't look. <br>
              Cause I know im a girl, but that's not what I see, what my family see, even what strangers see. <br>
              But the only thing that hurts worse is when you try your hardest to be yourself and everyone ignores that. <br>
              People refuse to see your true self even when you scream it in there face. <br>
              Is this karma? <br>
              Is this payback for everything wrong I've done in life? <br>
              I'll never know the answer. <br>
              But regardless of a reason why, it doesn't go away. <br>
              It stays. <br>
              Life is hard, but when your self-respect is torn away and the weight of the world is then added, you break. <br>
              Then it's up to you to put yourself back together again. <br>
              Not fair is it? <br>
              But yet I still get up, and work on my day the best that I can. <br>
              It's painful, but I numb that pain with hope. <br>
              Hope that one day i'll change this feeling. <br>
              Hope that one day i'll look in the mirror and say to myself "This is me:' Without having to fake it. <br>
              I'll take it. <br>
              Take everything that life throws my way. <br>
              Cause I've been on a war path and I'm just waiting for that day. <br>
              My day. <br>
              I know it will come to me. <br>
              I know it can happen. <br>
              It will happen. <br>
              But in order for me to get the victory, I have to surpass the war. <br>

            <h3>Malnourished</h3>
            <p>
              I'm addicted.<br>
              I'm a feen for the drug of your attention.<br>
              A drop that is your love.<br>
              Strike down from above the bits that you leave for me.<br>
              It's not enough.<br>
              Now for a new chapter I write,<br>
              All the laughter in my sight.<br>
              I know nothing but pain.<br>
              The happiness is an llusion that guides me from myself to a calm place to be.<br>
              I think about you...<br>
              Every night of every day,<br>
              the times before I lay,<br>
              the words I speak before you are my beliefs.<br>
              Yet you ignore them.<br>
              They aren't taken in.<br>
              To you they're obsolete but to me it's what I eat.<br>
              I feed off the words you say to me.<br>
              Yet unlike a street drug this shouldn't cost money.<br>
              The love you give should be unconditionally for free.<br>
              I shouldn't have to ask or beg.<br>
              Things always get so complicated.<br>
              Words so powerful you should stop thinking about how it sounds to you, but how it sounds to me.<br>
              Drifting through the night my thoughts.<br>
              They line up into straight lines to be fired as a bullet from the gun used in combat.<br>
              My thoughts are a fight.<br>
              One so violent every hospital in a radius is in code black.<br>
              The comeback is the bed I lay.<br>
              A "Good Nights Rest" is only as good as the night.<br>
              So if you ask me how my sleep was and I say bad understand that this isn't sleep.<br>
              The word sleep has symbolic meaning behind it.<br>
              When someone says "I'm going to sleep" it sounds peaceful.<br>
              So I didn't sleep.<br>
              I was knocked unconscious due to the severity of my wounds in a fight I didn't win.<br>
              Yet I still arise the next or same day with hours in the past and infinity in the future I wait.<br>
              Just cause I can now see the battlefield doesn't mean I can win.<br>
              It tease the inevitability of my lost.<br>
              Yet when I still hear that addiction can be cured I laugh.<br>
              Since every ounce of my Fentanyl called hope will always feel like a screen I use my laughter as my totem.<br>
              And only when the punchline is no longer painful will I know I've waken up.<br>

          <div id="sectionNudity" class="nudity hidden">
            <h3>Nudity</h3>
            <p>
              Nudity comforts me.<br />
              Not something that is average for someone like me.<br />
              Gender dysphoria and depression sends your self-esteem into recession.<br />
              My body causing me more oppression than my environment.<br />
              The sentiment that I self harm more than my reality could ever harm me.<br />
              The social construct that I must exist one way verse another.<br />
              That my reality is nothing more than a faze I'll grow out of.<br />
              As if my imaginary friend is my true self and what you see is only what my fear will let you.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              When I say, Nudity comforts me, it will confuse you.<br />
              Many people in the world believe you must be in constant agony in order to be trans.<br />
              That you resent your body 60/60/24/7/365.<br />
              To many, there are truly no happy times.<br />
              Those people I feel for.<br />
              I haven't felt your pain so I won't act like I do.<br />
              Yet the justification that you need constant dysphoria to be trans...simply isn't true.<br />
              I still have things I can't bare.<br />
              Like looking into a mirror, being touched, or the occasional shower.<br />
              But my body is the pinnacle of towers, the opus of an art work I take the pleasure of being in.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The comfort only comes when alone.<br />
              And when I say alone, I mean it with people that relate.<br />
              The sub-genre of society that can be alone while together and bond when no one else wants to.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The question is "How?"<br />
              My life is a fictional autobiography, one that is falsely depicted by many.<br />
              I see myself as the main character.<br />
              With the book unfinished, ample changes can be made.<br />
              My true view of self is wrapped together in twine.<br />
              Redeveloped and redesigned.<br />
              What I see isn't what I know.<br />
              My body has more than show.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              In the comfort of my solitary I emerge with solidarity.<br />
              I take comfort in my nudity with the mental image of my unity.<br />
              Surrounded in the continuity, I wasn't born the true me.<br />

              The crimes against humanity I'd commit if it could guaranty my vanity I admit, <br /> my mind isn't always a peaceful place.<br />
              My starved population of prisoners.<br />
              Thieves and liars.<br />
              The fires that burn them from the earth.<br />
              My scorched lands and tarnished sees.<br />
              I'm up to my head it fees.<br />
              I feel like my debit has finally caught up to me.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              My mind and body have been given the ability to consent to a concept people will judge for.<br />
              The choices that I make with my own flesh and blood should be mind to make but instead, they've been taken from me.<br />
              Surrounded by misogyny and transphobia it makes things harder to cope with.<br />
              A single people's ignorance is all it takes.<br />
              The wishes made while blowing out candles on cakes are on there way here.<br />
              I'm starting to wonder if I'll be alive to greet them when they land.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The "perfect date" of walking on the sand down a beach with a hand in my hand thinking, why wasn't <i>THIS</i> planned?<br />
              Instead, I have to hear about the deaths of my sisters being beaten in the streets and<br /> all the world leaders ignoring the rising heat.<br />
              I'm waking up within an America that has yet to be great as it runs on greed and hate.<br />
              Then when minorities groups together the ones in power like to go, "Hey, we can relate!"<br />
              How is this our fate?
              This isn't safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm growing up in a world where speaking out is a sin, but lying is forgiven.<br />
              Where I am a sinner for making a personal decision to live the way I want and<br /> the cherry-picking religion sticking hypocritical cynical false prophets of the world will condemn my incision to become who I please.<br />
              A world were people in my nation still believe my skin color is an inclination that<br /> I'm up for dictation and I am sick and tired of this relation.<br />
              I'm tired of the death and destruction for nothing but monetary gain.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm starting to hear the rain.<br />
              There isn't proper health care for the poor and insane.<br />
              The rich kill remorselessly in vain.<br />
              The ideals that our current president pushes fuel the people who wish to split me by the vein,<br /> and everyone at the bottom of the totem pole is meant to sit back and watch.<br />
              This isn't the horror movie I paid to see.<br />
              I demand a refund for the cruelty.<br />
              Our humanity should be worth more than humor for thoes that wish death apon me.<br />

            <p>Dear future self,<br />
              How do you live?<br />
              I ask you this because when you were a kid you believed every saying by the slitest.
              In your mind you were just a stastic.<br />
              A number in an aray of people.<br />
              Yet, you are so much more.<br />
              You would use this to go to war with yourself on every decision you make.
              When I ask "How do you live?", i'm asking weather or not you're scared to go outside by yourself, or if you're able to walk where you want, when you want.
            </p>
            <p>Dear future self,<br />
              Where do you live?<br />
              I ask this because when you where young you believed that you would never leave Detroit.
              Yet, i believe you do.<br />
              I believe you can do anything you put your mind to.
              That you are alot stronger than you think.
              You were on the brink of Death, but insted, you became something you never thought you would.
              You should continue on with yourself to prove to the world that you aren't some stastic.
            </p>
            <p>Dear future self,<br />
              Stop looking at your scars as shameful parts of your past.
              Look at them as the battle scars that show the proof that you went to hell, and survived.
              Inside you are a flower just trying to survive, and you are going to have thoes weeds that follow around.</p>
